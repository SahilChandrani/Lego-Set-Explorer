**Guided Power BI Project – Maven Analytics**

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to explore 18,000+ LEGO sets released from 1970 to 2022. The project includes details such as set names, themes, number of pieces, recommended age, retail prices, and images. Designed to answer key business questions through visual analysis and DAX calculations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Load and clean LEGO dataset (remove nulls and unnecessary columns)  
- Categorize sets by age and price ranges using conditional columns  
- Create DAX measures for total sets, average price, average pieces, etc.  
- Design a clean, interactive dashboard layout using slicers and cards  
- Add a decomposition tree to explore themes and categories  
- Implement tooltips, dynamic filters, bookmarks, and reset buttons
