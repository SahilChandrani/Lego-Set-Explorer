# LEGO Set Explorer Dashboard

**Power BI Project | Guided by Maven Analytics**

This project analyzes over 18,000 LEGO sets released between 1970 and 2022. The goal was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that explores themes, pricing, age groups, and set complexity — without relying on traditional bar or line charts. The dashboard focuses on clean user experience, interactivity, and deep-level drilldowns.
